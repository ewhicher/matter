One of the driving forces of his globally transformational endeavours was a critical need to reliably communicate with his wife – both hearing-impaired. Text-based communications didn’t just make things better for Vinton and his wife Sigrid, nor the roughly 5% of people on this planet with a hearing disability, it made life better for all of us. In 2023 we send and receive 347.3 billion emails a day.'
