        text: 'The next 5 years will be critical to the future of the automotive industry. New consumer values will drive a greater preference for individuality, self-expression and sustainability. New technologies will impact every aspect of the journeys we make – from the modes of transport we select, to where and how we spend our money. And new disruptors will enter the market, injecting ever greater competition and choice to a consumer more concerned with social currency than material or financial possessions. All of these factors, and many more, demand we seek a new approach.'
