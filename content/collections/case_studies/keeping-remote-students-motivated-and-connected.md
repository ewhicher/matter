        text: "Unsurprisingly, we found that remote learning can be a lonely pursuit, especially when many of the students are fitting the coursework around their day job and other commitments. Without a strong support network, it can be easy to fall behind and quietly quit the course. This is a lose-lose situation, where the student doesn't gain the qualification they set out to achieve, and the University loses a paying student."
